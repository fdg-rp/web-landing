## Store Robbery
Store robberies are the first step to becoming a professional thief and they’re quite easy to do however it’s also the least rewarding.

1. First step to robbing stores is to get a firearm and a getaway vehicle. Having another person as a getaway driver and lookout is the most ideal. You can have a **MAXIMUM** of `6` people in store robberies.

2. Next, you have to find a store with a clerk that’s working. There are many gas stations, liquor stores and restaurants around Los Santos. 

3. When you’ve entered the store, aim your firearm at the clerk and they will fill up bags full of cash until they empty the register. If you stop aiming your gun the clerk will stop filling the bags. If the store has been robbed recently there won’t be any money left in the till and he will let you know you’re wasting your time.

4. Watch out for the cops because now you’re on the radar and it’s getaway time! Good luck you filthy criminal.

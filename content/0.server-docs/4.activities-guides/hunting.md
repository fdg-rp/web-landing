## About
Hunting is a good legal source of making money. It’s time consuming, satisfying and rewarding. There is a variety of wildlife scattered across the county and the ocean to hunt and skin to sell for money.


## Getting Started

1. Find Bonk the Hunter
- The First step to start your hunting journey is to find Bonk the Hunter, he is residing in his hunting cabin on Roxwood. Bonk will introduce you to the world of hunting and issue your Hunting Licence
2. Purchase Licenses

## How to Hunt

1. To start hunting, you will need to search for wildlife. They are generally found in mountains, swamps and woodland areas or then ocean.
2. Kill an animal using either the Hunting Rifle or Crossbow. Keep in mind you can only use a crossbow in the ocean and require scuba gear.
3. Once you kill an animal you will have the option to skin them by pressing ```E``` with a hunting knife in your hands and selecting skin animal. Be mindful you cannot skin more than one animal at a time during the animation.
4. Once you are happy with your haul, head back to Bonk. He will purchase the harvested goods from you

2. Being able to carry a Carcass allows you to move it closer to your tent

## Tents

1. Tent's operate in the same way an Esky does. It is a physical item in your inventory that you need to place down 
2. Once you have placed a Tent down you can share a beer with your mates and earn some extra XP when you skin an animal close to it!
3. Don't forget to pack your Tent up when you're finished hunting for the day!

## Bait

The new bait system allows you to lure animals towards your bait over the course of 5 minutes where the animals would of finally eaten all the bait, you may only place 1 bait down and will not be able to place another until the bait has been eaten, there are 4 stages of bait and the stages match the below leveling tiers so make sure to buy the right one. As you go up the tiers, the rate that the animals are attracted to the bait will increase per bait stage. 

## Leveling Tiers
Depending on your level, you can hunt different tiers of animals. See below for what you can hunt based on your level

Tier 1 (0-25) - Novice Wildlife:
 - Deer, Boar, Coyote, Crow, Rabbit, Rat, Red Panda, Skunk

## Bundles (COMING SOON)
When talking to Bonk inside the Hunting Cabin there will be a “Bundle Store” option that you can access. Within this store, a select variety of meats will be listed that you can sell together for a higher price than you would regularly in the store. These bundles will change regularly, so it’s in your best interest to explore different hunting grounds, and to do so throughout the day and night as this changes the animals you can hunt!

## Tips & Tricks

- Hunting without licences is illegal and can lead to charges from the San Andreas Rangers Service (SARS)

- When shooting guns, animals get scared. Find a position where you can shoot multiple animals at once when they run.

- Animals tend to look for shelter and rest when it’s night time and raining. Pick your time to hunt and make the most of your time when the weather is good. 

- Team up with your friends and work together to split the profits. Hunting can be a fun group activity.

Banned for cheating or hacking? **You will not be unbanned.** Click to lean more.
#content
FDG adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards hacking and cheating. If you were banned for cheating or hacking (see [Community Rule C2](/server-docs/rules/community-wide-rules)) you will **not be unbanned**.

Exceptions only occur when evidence submitted proves you did not cheat or hack. 

Remember, the account owner bears full responsibility for the actions carried out through their account, irrespective of the person using it.
::


All account owners *generally* have the right to appeal administrative decisions issued against their account. Administrative decisions include:

- Timeouts
- Warnings
- Temporary & Permanent Bans

You should submit an appeal if you reasonably believe:

- An administrative decision was issued incorrectly; or,
- An administrative decision is overly harsh

## Submitting an Appeal

All appeals must be submitted online via the [FDG Support Portal](https://support.fatduckgaming.com/tickets/create/29). The FDG Forums, where appeals were formerly lodged, reached end-of-life mid 2023.

### Step 1 - Consider Your Eligibility

Although all players have a *general* right to appeal, there are several rules and eligibility requirements to consider. Considering your eligibility **before submitting an appeal** can prevent wasted time.

Appeals submitted for bans issued in response to a breach of [Community Rule C2](/server-docs/rules/community-wide-rules) are **automatically denied**. Exceptions only occur when submitted evidence proves the ban was issued in error. [Community Rule C2](/server-docs/rules/community-wide-rules) captures:

::list{type="danger"}
- Cheating 
- Hacking 
- Exploiting 
::

You should only consider appealing an administrative decision if:

::list{type="success"}
- An administrative decision was issued incorrectly; or,
- An administrative decision is overly harsh
::

### Step 2 - Gather Evidence

Evidence is **required** for most appeals. Prior to drafting an appeal, upload any evidence you intend to submit to a streaming or hosting service like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Streamable](https://streamable.com/), or [Imgur](https://imgur.com/). 

Any video evidence submitted must meet FDG's minimum standards listed below. Submitted footage not complying with these standards **may not be considered** when assessing your appeal.

::list{type="warning"}
 - Must include at least **2 minutes** of RP, if applicable; and,
 - Must include **audio**, if available; and,
 - Must not be **edited**, except for trimming
::

### My appeal was denied, can I appeal again?
Maybe. Administrative appeal decisions are ganerally **final**. You should not appeal again unless instructed to again at a later date. Staff may provide a re-appeal period in the response to your original appeal. Continually submitting appeals unnecessarily may result in you account being banned form access FDG Support Services, meaning you'll never be able to submit an appeal again.

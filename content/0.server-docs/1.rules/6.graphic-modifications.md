# Graphic Modifications Guidlines

::alert{type="warning"}
**TL;DR** Graphical modifications for the purpose of gaining an advantage over other players will be actioned under **[Community rule C2](/server-docs/rules/community-wide-rules)**.
::

Whilst we understand some players have computer issues, we will no longer tolerate the use of graphics mods (or even intentionally low settings) which give a significant advantage over others. This includes daylight mod, playing with no shadows, external crosshairs, stretched resolution or intentionally distorted color profiles. **We will take a 0 tolerance approach to this, if you would like to clarify if your settings are valid, open a ticket on the [support portal](https://support.fatduckgaming.com).**

### Currently Banned

::list{type="danger"}

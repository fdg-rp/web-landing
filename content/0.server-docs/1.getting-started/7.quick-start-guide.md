Once you have cash and decided what you want to buy simply drag the item to your inventory and type in the amount you want. This will deduct the amount from the cash in your inventory and give you the items.

## Purchasing and Using Radios

Radios are an excellent tool for communicating with friends and can be purchased at the same store where you buy phones for $200.

![Phone Store Davis Avenue](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/189f9e04-1e69-4191-a444-16689fe73f04_1726657373272.png)

## Driver's License

To operate a car, you'll need a driver's license. Operating a vehicle without the appropriate license is an offence and could get you in trouble with the Police.

1.  Make your way to the  **Driving School**  found near the airport.
![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/f2a2292b-4958-4f2f-80f1-c438273c4107_1727237521008.png)

3.  Complete the  **written test**. You can browse all the road and traffic rules in the  [San Andreas Register of Law](https://law.fatduckgaming.com/laws/traffic).
4.  Complete the  **practical test**. Remember, you must adhere to all the  [road and traffic rules](https://law.fatduckgaming.com/laws/traffic).
5.  Once both tests are complete, make your way to the  **License Building**  to print out your new driver's license.
![enter image description here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1252544615828029441/1282172867953430528/License_Centre.png?ex=66f4cd89&is=66f37c09&hm=eb834855b4d934d20a12d7abce088592001a4ac9cf77cb4c85bb8f0a0e6f89bd&=)
6.  Find the  **green interaction blip**  inside the **License Building** to print out your new driver's license. The game will take control of your character momentarily to take a license photo.

## Purchasing First Car

One of the most awesome extras of FDG is the variety of cars! We have a range of different dealerships in the city that either provide you brand new or second hand cars. Places such as **Premium Deluxe Motorsport (PDM)** offer you brand new cars which is your best starting point. 

![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/58157711-7228-45f6-b87c-c781f0e7ae1f_1726663594142.png)

You can get a new car for as little as $575 from PDM as well as our mechanics such as **LSC, Flywheels, Benny's and Hayes** that have second hand cars for $500,000 plus.   

Also don't forget to check **Marketplace, Twitter and pop-up car sales** for any second hand car deals. 

**PDM** does not have any active employee's but instead you go to the show room blip as seen below in the picture

![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/39480c4b-e927-4315-b8a8-eb64bd1cddc2_1725671765776.png)

You are then taken into a purchasing menu where you can find cheap cars such as the Glendale under 'Sedan' as seen below 

![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/e189b9e3-dae3-4715-a95d-211ddec7bd45_1725671956061.png)

Select the vehicle you're after by pressing enter and follow the prompts. Just remember you must have the funds available in your bank. This system does not allow you to go into a negative balance or take the cash out of your inventory. 

The same kind of system can be found at any of the Mechanics however a car is purchased via a sales assistant. If you wish to check their stock and prices of new/used cars you must request a sales assistant to help you.
  
ALERT: Congrats, now you know how to purchase your first car and start your car journey in FDG!

## Making Money

There are a lot of different ways to make money in FDG! You can either choose the legal or illegal route however keep in mind making money illegally comes with it's risks!

Let's go through some legal ways to make money and get you started. 

There are such jobs like
- **Go Postal** 
- **Council jobs**
- **Farming** (You make money from selling the fruit & vegetables you collect)
- **Car parts** (You will need to bring your own vehicle)
- **Fishing** (You will need to by a fishing rod) How to - https://fatduckgaming.com/server-docs/activities-guides/fishing
- **Trucking** (You will need to buy your own truck from the trucking depot) How to - https://fatduckgaming.com/server-docs/activities-guides/trucking
- **Diving** (You will need to purchase a knife & put on scuba tank at the clothing store) How to - https://fatduckgaming.com/server-docs/activities-guides/diving
- **Hunting** (You will need to purchase a knife, hunting rife & bullets) How to - https://fatduckgaming.com/server-docs/activities-guides/hunting


The three jobs that don't require you to bring anything but yourself like **Go Postal**, **Farming** and **Council jobs** are the best to start with. They can be found on your map as shown in the pictures below and have multiple locations to pick up jobs on your map. 

![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/1bc7e669-83a1-4733-8ada-0ca8f4eb5976_1725676525882.png)
![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/8dc87fd8-cc12-4e0e-9828-f7d66d39e7f6_1725676583545.png)
![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/527c71d4-e49b-4e53-b696-c97ac356cf92_1725676630540.png)

There is an option of applying for player ran businesses such as mechanics and entertainment however some may require you to have in city experience beforehand rather than applying on your first day. Set yourself up properly, navigate the city and understand the rules of roleplay before starting that next journey in your FDG career. 

Once you have done that you can head over to the **Government building**, select '**Application Jobs**' and look through the list of jobs that interest you. Keep in mind they are organised through actual players so put some time and effort into your job application is a must to stand out from the crowd!

![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/7887df65-57a6-4f41-b662-57d277adcdb1_1725678734017.png)

If you are interested in joining the **San Andreas Emergency services** or **San Andreas Police Department** you must make different characters for each of them and apply as they are 'full time' jobs. Again you will need to have some experience in city before applying as they will most likely reject you if you're fresh to the city. 

Something to keep in mind with the **SAES** & **SAPD** is applications are not always available and tend to alert players via the **FDG Government discord** when applications are open. 

You can join that discord by following this link - https://discord.gg/jFBgaWt

## Renting Property

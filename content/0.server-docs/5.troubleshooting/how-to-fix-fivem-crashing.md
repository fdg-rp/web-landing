Outdated graphics drivers can often cause crashes. Visit the website of your graphics card manufacturer (such as NVIDIA or AMD) and download the latest drivers for your specific model. Install the drivers and restart your computer to apply the changes.

### Verify Game Files

If you are experiencing crashes specifically in relation to GTA V content, it is important to verify the game files. This process will check for any corrupted or missing files and fix them if required.

#### How to Verify Game Files on Steam

1. Open Steam and click on the Library tab.
2. `Right-click` on `GTAV` from the left panel and select the `Properties` option.
3. Click on the `Local Files` tab.
4. Click on the `Verify Integrity of Game Files`.
5. Let it scan your files and if any are missing/corrupted let it reinstall them

#### How to Verify Game Files on Epic Games

1. Open Steam and find your game in the libary.
2. Click the `three dots` on the right side of the game line.
3. Select Manage.
4. Click the `Verify` button.

5. Let it scan your files and if any are missing/corrupted let it reinstall them

### FiveM Channel Update

Playing the latest stable release is a common way in avoiding crashes and freezing. Sometimes people play `Latest (Unstable)` as it may be more beneficial to solve UI Lag, but as it says in the name, it is unstable and can cause crashes to occur frequently.

Follow these steps to help set your gamemode to `Release` version.

1. Launch FiveM
2. Click on `Settings` in the top right corner.
3. Click on `Game`.
4. At the top, there should be three options: `Release`, `Beta`, `Latest (Unstable)`.
5. Select `Release`.
6. Restart FiveM.

### Disable Antivirus/Firewall

Sometimes, antivirus or firewall software can interfere with FiveM's functionality and cause crashes. Temporarily disable your antivirus and firewall programs to see if the crashes persist. If the issue no longer occurs, you should whitelist FiveM in your security software or adjust its settings accordingly.

### Disable Resource-Heavy Modifications

If you have installed additional mods or resource packs in FiveM, it is possible that one of them is causing conflicts and crashes. Temporarily remove any resource-heavy modifications and restart FiveM to see if the crashes stop. If this resolves the issue, try adding the mods back one by one to identify the problematic one.

### Close Unnecessary Background Processes

Ensure that you don't have any resource-intensive programs or unnecessary background processes running while playing FiveM. Close unused applications, especially those that consume a lot of memory or CPU power, as they can potentially conflict with FiveM and lead to crashes.

### Update FiveM

Make sure you are using the latest version of FiveM. Developers frequently release updates and bug fixes that can address crashes and stability issues. Check the official FiveM website or relevant forums to download and install the most recent version.

## Still Crashing?

If the crashes continue after following these steps, consider seeking assistance from the FiveM community forums, official support channels, fat duck gaming support channel sometimes people can help you if they have knowlege on that subject or a previous experience to it, or contacting the FiveM developers directly for more specific troubleshooting options.

Remember to always provide detailed information about the crashes, such as any error messages, recent changes, or specific patterns to help others assist you in finding a solution.

# How to Minimise UI Lag on FiveM

If you are experiencing lag in the UI of FiveM, there are several steps you can take to minimise it and *potentially* fix it, enhancing your experience on FiveM.

## Turn on `NUI in-process GPU`

You can try turning on this built-in FiveM setting to help reduce UI lag.

1. Launch FiveM and go to Settings.
2. Click on `Settings` in the top right corner.
3. Click on `Game`.
4. Toggle `NUI in-process GPU`.

## FiveM Channel Update

1. Launch FiveM and go to Settings.
2. Click on `Settings` in the top right corner.
3. Click on `Game`.
4. At the top, there should be three options: `Release`, `Beta`, `Latest (Unstable)`.
5. Select `Latest (Unstable)`.
6. Restart FiveM.

Using the `Latest (Unstable)` channel update in FiveM will possibly make you more vulnerable to FiveM crashes. If crashing becomes more frequent after setting it to `Latest (Unstable)`, it's recommended to go to the `Release` version as it's the most stable version of FiveM.

## Clear Cache

Clearing your cache will remove any temporary files and data stored on your computer that may be slowing down the UI.

## Update Drivers

Sometimes, outdated drivers can cause issues with FiveM's UI performance. Follow these steps to update your drivers:

1. Go to the manufacturer's website for your video and audio drivers.
2. Download the latest versions for your system.
3. Install the updated drivers.
4. Restart FiveM and see if the UI lag has been resolved.

## FiveM Modifications

The installation of additional mods, such as those listed as NVE, QuantV, ENB, Reshade, and others of the sort, has the potential to impact UI performance and disrupt gameplay. In response to this, it is suggested that players temporarily remove these mods to evaluate their impact on UI lag. Such an assessment can aid in identifying the root of any issues that may arise and provide players with the necessary steps for addressing them.

## Uninstall Unwanted Programs

Sometimes, other programs running on your computer can interfere with FiveM's UI performance. Here is how to uninstall unwanted programs:

1. Press `Windows key + R` to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type `appwiz.cpl` and press `Enter` to open the Programs and Features window.
3. Look for any unwanted programs and `Uninstall` them.
4. Restart FiveM and see if the UI lag has been resolved.

Clearing your cache **shouldn't** be your first step in troubleshooting. Also note, clearing your cache will remove downloaded custom asssets from **all servers**, not just Fat Duck Gaming.
::

1. Right click on your FiveM launcher, and select "Open File Location". If this isnt an option, press `WINDOWS KEY + R`, search `appdata`, go to `local` and locate `FiveM` file.

4. In the `data` folder there should be 5 folders within it. You **only** need to delete **3** of them which are `cache` `server-cache` `server-cache-priv` go ahead and **delete** these folders.

5. Empty your recycle bin. This isnt needed but is recommended to free up device storage. Locate recycle bin on your desktop right click on it and click **Empty Recycke Bin** and its as simple as that your cache is now gone.

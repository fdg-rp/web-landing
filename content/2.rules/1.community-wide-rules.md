# Community-Wide Rules (C-Rules)

Applicable across the entire FDG Community

---

**C1**- Be respectful of other players and do not initiate inappropriate roleplay onto, or around players you aren't familiar with. Keep in mind this community is twitch streamer friendly.

**C2** - Usage of cheats, exploits, or third-party services (including Twitch streams and real-world trading) to gain an advantage is strictly prohibited.

**C3** - Staff decisions are non0negotiable, however, if you believe a decision was made incorrectly you can report it on the forums. Ignoring or failing to adhere to staff instructions and/or lying to staff during a situation is treated as a serious offence.

**C4** - Advertising on official FDG platforms is not permitted, however, exceptions can be made for official content creators (by talking with a community leader).

**C5** - Community Leaders may make exemptions to the rules on a case-by-case basis, at their discretion for a specific roleplay scenario only, on the grounds to promote a better roleplay experience or fair play.
